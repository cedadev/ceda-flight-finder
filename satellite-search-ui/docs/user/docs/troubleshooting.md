Troubleshooting
===============

Why aren't there many results?
------------------------------

To keep the search interface lightweight and fast, only the first 1000
results are drawn on the screen. There may be more hits in a given area, but
they may not be drawn by the interface - this is to improve performance and
keep the searches working in real-time. The total number of results is displayed below
the **Export Results** button. It is best to refine the search to get fewer than 1000
results.

Why is the quicklook image the wrong orientation?
-------------------------------------------------

This is a known issue and has been brought from the ESA (European Space Agency) archive.
There is no fix at this time. In the future a solution may be explored.

Why is it taking so long to load?
---------------------------------

The results have been limited to 1000 to help with rendering performance but speed is
dependant on your internet connection and the speed of your computer. If it appears that the
page is stuck, load time > 20 seconds, refreshing the page will usually snap it back.

Where is the rectangle tool?
----------------------------

There has been one instance where the rectangle tool and map key were rendered below the map.
This indicates that the styling has not loaded properly.

This can be fixed by performing a hard refresh using **Shift + F5** or **Shift + Click Refresh** in browser.
