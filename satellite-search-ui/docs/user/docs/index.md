CEDA Satellite Data Finder Help Pages
==============================

The Interface
-------------

The screen in front of you is split into two sections. On the left
is a side panel with accordion-style expanding elements that contain
useful elements for refining your search parameters. On the right is a
large map with coloured polygons overlaid on top.

These polygons are the boundaries of scenes extracted from satellite data
contained within the CEDA archive.

You can pan around the map by clicking and dragging on the map. The map's
bounding box will automatically change, and the interface will automatically
search for and display scenes within the area. You can also zoom in and out
using the controls in the bottom right of the map. The map functionality uses Google Maps, so
the interface should be familiar if you have used that before.


Looking at Your Results
-----------------------

Each polygon is clickable and will bring up an information dialogue when
selected. This will provide some basic information about each individual file
including the recorded start and end time for the data, the file name, the satellite mission,
satellite name and instrument name. An example is shown below:

If there is a quicklook thumbnail image in the archive, this will be displayed.
Clicking on this image will bring up a larger image.

There are also buttons where you can directly download the scene or view the source directory on the archive.

### Dataset on Tape

If the dataset has been moved to tape storage the download buttons will not be available 
but there is a link to tell you how to gain access to the dataset.
