The number of hits, for your\ncurrent search parameters, is displayed below the \nExport Results\n button. \nOnly 1000 will be drawn on the map or are extractable\nvia the \nExport Results\n dialog to increase performance.\n\n\nTemporal Filter\n\n\nThis element will allow you to refine your search with temporal parameters.\nYou can enter a start time and end time, click \nApply Filters\n and the interface will search for\nsatellite data that was recorded within that period. \n\n\nTo help you see the distribution of data over time, there is a convenient\nhistogram underneath the start and end time box. A larger bar means that more\ndata files were recorded within that time period. Note that the histogram\ndisplays counts for \nall\n available data\n, and is not modified by changing the filters.\n\n\nClicking the histogram bars is a shortcut to selecting a specific year but it will likely be necessary to \nrefine your search further to get the most benefit from the interface.\n\n\nChange Map Centre\n\n\nThis element allows you to search for a location. If it finds what you're\nsearching for, the map will centre on the matching location. You can enter\nseveral different types of things to find a location. For example, all of the\nthings below are valid location searches:\n\n\n\n\nPlace names (e.g. \"Scotland\", \"London\", or \"Turl Street\")\n\n\nPostcodes (e.g. \"90210\" or \"OX11 0QN\")\n\n\nCoordinates (e.g. \"51.2W, 31.0N\" or \"51.7595, -1.2325\")\n\n\n\n\nRectangle Search\n\n\nFound in the top right corner of the map. Toggle \nOn\n by clicking the button. \nWhen turned on, draw on the map using the cursor. Once your drawing is complete, the map\nwill search for results which intersect the box drawn. \n\n\nOnly 100 are drawn to avoid overburdening the map.\n\n\nYou can resize the rectangle using the white nodes. You can also move\nthe rectangle by grabbing one of the sides, marked by the black line. \n\n\nThe coordinates of the NW and SE corners are automatically updated in the \nRectangle Search\n pane on the left hand\nside of the screen.\n\n\nThe \nClear Results\n button will remove all the coloured polygons from the screen. This can make it easier to edit\nthe rectangular bounding box. Simply click \nApply Filters\n to get results matching your bounding box.\n\n\nThe rectangle and all\nother filters can be removed by clicking \"Clear Filters\".\n\n\nWhen the rectangle tool is \nOn\n, panning is disabled on the map. Turn the tool off to \nresume panning.\n\n\n\n\nSatellite Filter\n\n\nThis element provides checkboxes to filter down the specific satellites which you want to\nretrieve data from. The number displayed to the right of the element indicates the number\nof datasets available given the current filters.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\nGiven the current selection, there are no datasets from the Landsat Missions 5 and 7. You can try\nchanging the time range or search area.\n\n\nApply Filters\n\n\nThis button simply applys any search criteria you may have entered. For\nexample, if you have supplied a date range and a keyword, clicking \"Apply\nFilters\" will apply these criteria to your search.\n\n\nCertain things are done automatically - the Geographical Search will reresh your results once you click \nGo\n and the Satellite\nFilter is applied without needing to click \"Apply Filters\".\n\n\nClear Filters\n\n\nThis clears the map of all objects, data polygons and rectangles, and resets all the filters to a neutral state.",
