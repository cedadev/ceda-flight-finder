# ceda-map-uis
Web-based CEDA map-interfaces for finding flights.

## User Interface
The User Interface for the Flight Finder allows users to filter specific flights by multiple parameters:
 - Flight Search:
   - Flight Number or Project Code
   - Maximum Number of Flights to display
 - Keyword Search
 - Instrument Filter
 - Collection Filter
 - Variable Filter
 - Temporal Filter

## Pending Changes
Currently User Interface Changes may be required:
 - Collection Filter using buttons not switchbox
 - Instrument and Variable Filters combined?
 - Geospatial Filter still useful?
